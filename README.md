🌧️ Chennai Rainfall – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
</div></h1>
📘 Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Chennai’s daily rainfall data, aiming to explore seasonal patterns, extreme rainfall events, and long-term climatic trends.

Through visualizations and data insights, this analysis helps in understanding Chennai’s unique Northeast monsoon behavior, vital for urban planning and water resource management.

🧠 Objectives

✅ Clean and preprocess raw rainfall data
✅ Explore yearly and seasonal rainfall variations
✅ Visualize rainfall trends, peaks, and outliers
✅ Identify monsoon anomalies using data visualization

🗂️ Dataset Information

📁 File: Chennai Daily Rainfall Data.csv
📅 Attributes:

Date – Daily timestamp

Rainfall (mm) – Daily precipitation amount

(Additional weather parameters if available)

📊 Source: Indian Meteorological Department (IMD)
